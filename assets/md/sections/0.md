Code-Operative is a community of tech freelancers based in the North-East of England, with members and affiliates based further afield as well. Code-Opâ€™s processes are designed to bridge the gap between freelancers and the clients who need them, operating a not-for-profit model which puts quality and needs of the client and freelancer first.
