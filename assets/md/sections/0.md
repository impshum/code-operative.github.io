Code-Operative is a community of tech freelancers based in the North-East of England, with members and affiliates based further afield as well. Code-Opâ€™s processes are designed to bridge the gap between freelancers and the clients who need them, operating a not-for-profit model which puts quality and the needs of client and freelancer first. We can offer the traditional role-based services of an agency but we can also manage existing projects and build new systems from scratch.
